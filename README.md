# spring-cloud-kubernetes-demo

Spring Cloud is an umbrella of projects that help us to build Cloud Native Java application using Spring Ecosystem. 
Here I will show you how, using the Spring Cloud Abstraction, it is very easy to switch between specific vendor implementation 
without change one line of code, in particular this application can run on Spring Cloud Netflix and the lastest Spring Cloud Kubernetes 
availing only on profiled Maven/Gradle build and Spring profile.
